# Experiments with gevent

A simple program to try implementing a gevent based server.


# Usage

Start the server using `python server.py`. Listens on port 5000.

Users can then connect to the port using `telnet`. It will ask you for your name and then connect you.

The following commands are available

north, south, east, west to move
look for a description
get to pick up an object
say Foo Hello to say Hello to Foo (if he's in the same room).
quit to disconnect

# Issues

It's got tons of issues none of which I'm going to fix.
